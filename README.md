# Simple Calculator

Welcome to the Simple Calculator GitHub repository! This repository contains a basic Python program that functions as a text-based calculator, allowing users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers.

## Features

- **Addition:** Adds two input numbers and displays the result.
- **Subtraction:** Subtracts the second input number from the first and displays the result.
- **Multiplication:** Multiplies two input numbers and displays the result.
- **Division:** Divides the first input number by the second (if the second is not zero) and displays the result. Handles division by zero with an appropriate error message.
- **Error Handling:** The program includes error handling to ensure that the user provides valid numeric inputs and avoids division by zero.
